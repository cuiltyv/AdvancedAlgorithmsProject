# The program should display the optimal way to wire with a new fiber optic, connecting neighborhoods in such a way that information can be shared between any two neighborhoods at the lowest possible cost, taking advantage of existing connections from the new wiring (which should not be included in the cost). Since the cities are just entering the technological world, it is required that someone visits each "non-central" neighborhood to deliver physical statements, advertising, notices, and printed notifications. Therefore, it is desired to know what is the shortest possible route that visits each neighborhood exactly once and returns to the original neighborhood at the end. Take into account that many times the minimum cost may involve passing through a central or more intermediate neighborhood. The program should display the route to consider as well as the cost. The program should generate the optimal route to go from all the central points to each other, passing through a non-central neighborhood if necessary. Next, a series of Cartesian points on the city map where new neighborhoods are planned to be connected will be read, and it should be determined which is the nearest neighborhood and Cartesian point to which it should be connected.
